        <h1 class="heading">Solutions to catalysing PETs adoption at Privacy-Enhancing Technology Summit Asia-Pacific
        </h1>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 1em; color: #39B7CD">Nov 15, 2022</div>
        <div>
            I had a great time discussing privacy-enhancing technologies' (PETs) topics with global experts in the
            roundtable discussions at Privacy-Enhancing Technology Summit Asia-Pacific today. ðŸ˜Š

            One of the major concerns was the adoption of PETs, and I have succinctly jotted down the gripping solutions
            brought to the table
        </div>

        <div class="para-pepr">
            <li>
                Government support and training are paramount in the adoption of PETs. Especially challenging is their
                early adoption.
            </li>

            <li class="para-pepr">
                Standardisation in the use of PETs is crucial. A step in this direction could be to have the vendors
                worldwide set standards on the use of PETs, which can be promulgated at the policy level. Once the
                standards and guidelines are published, there will be better awareness, acceptance and clarity of PETs.
            </li>

            <li class="para-pepr">
                Trust in PETs is another essential aspect. Can there be backdoors to a technology? Being transparent
                about a technology is one way to address it, for instance, by open-sourcing it.
            </li>

            <li class="para-pepr">
                Another dimension is the utility provided by PETs while offering reasonable privacy risk mitigation (to
                what extent can PETs convert "personal" data into "non-personal" data).
            </li>

            <li class="para-pepr">
                Internal and external stakeholders will tie PETs usage to the business value. However, the value offered
                by PETs should also be assessed at scale. For instance, a solution that is for a short duration can have
                business concerns.

            </li>

            <li class="para-pepr">
                An enterprise can incentivise users to adopt PETs (one of the leads shared that their company ties
                performance bonuses to handling the simulated phishing attacks :D ).
            </li>

            <li class="para-pepr">
                Lastly, evangelising the impact of PETs can be rewarding (for example, Apple leveraging privacy as a
                competitive edge).

            </li>
        </div>

        <div>
            Can PETs also address the concern related to privacy breaches: what data subjects got breached? And to what
            extent? What was the reason for the breach? ðŸ¤”
