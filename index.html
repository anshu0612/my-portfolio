      <span class="name">Anshu Singh, </span> Shaojing Fan, Mohan Kankanhalli<br>
      ACM International Conference on Multimedia 2021<br>

        <b>Abstract:</b> Human attributes prediction in visual media is a well-researched topic with a major focus on
        human faces.
        However, face images are often of high privacy concern as they can reveal an individual's identity. How to
        balance this trade-off between privacy and utility is a key problem among researchers and practitioners. In this
        study, we make one of the first attempts to investigate the human attributes (emotion, age, and gender)
        prediction under the different de-identification (eyes, lower-face, face, and head obfuscation) privacy
        scenarios. We first constructed the Diversity in People and Context Dataset (DPaC). We then performed a human
        study with eye-tracking on how humans recognize facial attributes without the presence of face and context.
        Results show that in an image, situational context is informative of a target's attributes. Motivated by our
        human study, we proposed a multi-tasking deep learning model - Context-Guided Human Attributes Prediction
        (CHAPNet), for human attributes prediction under privacy-preserving conditions. Extensive experiments on DPaC
        and three commonly used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CHAPNet in leveraging the situational
        context for a better interpretation of a target's attributes without the full presence of the target's face. Our
        research demonstrates the feasibility of visual analytics under de-identification for privacy.

                In multiple research domains, a human face is a well-studied object from visual content since it is
                a source of rich information, most notably the identity of an individual. Identity revelation from
                visual data can make one vulnerable to leakage of personal and sensitive information (e.g., sexual
                orientation [1], health condition [2], religious beliefs [3]), mental and social harassment [4], and
                much more.....
