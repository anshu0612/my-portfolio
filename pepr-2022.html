            The 2022 USENIX Conference on Privacy Engineering Practice and Respect (PEPR '22) focuses on designing and
            building products and systems that respect their users' privacy and the societies in which they operate.

            <div class="para">
                The conference was well-organized and was attended by a large number of privacy and security pundits.
                Some of the privacy topics that were covered included differential privacy, privacy threat modeling,
                consent management, effective privacy labelling and standardisation, privacy incident management,
                privacy in different areas (e.g., smart home devices, browsers, AI chatbots), privacy for vulnerable
                groups (e.g., children and non-binary gender), privacy by design and so on.

            <h2>Differential Privacy</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>In Practice</h3>
                Differential privacy (DP) is an increasingly popular tool for preserving individuals’ privacy by adding
                statistical uncertainty when sharing sensitive data. However, DP has practical challenges that include
                the need
                for iterative exploration and negotiation with data custodians and analysts on the choice of privacy
                parameters (e.g., epsilon and delta), DP variants (different algorithms/mechanisms e.g., Gaussian and
                Laplacian mechanisms), and data statistics (e.g., mean, variance and sum).
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Further, there is tension between data minimization (limiting data collection) and differential privacy:
                differential privacy
                gives nearly accurate results on large datasets, however, collecting a large amount of data can infringe
                the privacy of individuals and transgress regulations.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <h3>Contextual Integrity</h3>
                <a href="https://digifesto.com/2021/10/08/towards-a-synthesis-of-differential-privacy-and-contextual-integrity/"
                    target="blank">Contextual Integrity (CI)</a>, is another aspect that was introduced, to help with
                these decisional choices
                on applying DP. CI captures socially nuanced requirements of privacy. To capture such nuances, it comes
                with a template for understanding information norms in social context (e.g., education and healthcare),
                parameterized in terms of the sender, receiver,
                data subject of the personal information, sensitive attributes of the data subject, and transmission
                principle (the normative rule governing the conditions under which this parameterized information flow
                is (in)appropriate).

            <div class="para">
                <h3>Libraries</h3>
                A large number of DP libraries have been developed and open-sourced with the primary goal
                of assisting non-experts in applying DP. However, there is a dearth of libraries focusing on
                scalability. The two libraries introduced – <a href="https://gitlab.com/tumult-labs/core"

                Spark and Apache Beam to process massive datasets.

            <h2>Gender Privacy</h2>
            <div>
                Applications asking for users’ gender predominantly follow the norm of giving binary options.
                Technologists must recognize the complexity and dynamic nature of gender, as well as the disclosure
                concerns, and must be purpose limited (do you really need to collect gender?). These realizations can
                contribute to technological advancements that respect diverse social groups. Furthermore, the usage of
                gendered honorifics, salutations, and titles is an implicit manner of collecting gender (credit: an
                attendee sharing). This further underscores considering the cultural aspects of gender collection.

            <h2>Privacy in AI Chatbots</h2>
            <div>
                The disconcerting empirical findings revealed that chatbot users can share highly sensitive information
                such as political opinions, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and health data. Some promising
                solutions for developers were presented to address the potential privacy harm to users. These included
                identifying mental health and vulnerable populations, adjusting the interaction mode or interventions,
                safeguarding inadvertent sharing of sensitive information, and avoiding manipulative/dark patterns --
                design techniques that nudge users to less privacy-protective options.

                    <h3>DNS Privacy</h3>
                    <div class="para">
                        Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet's directory that resolves domain names. Anyone on the
                        network path between
                        one's device and the DNS resolver can see both the query containing the desired hostname (or
                        website) and the IP address identifying one's device. This browsing data has been monetized (for
                        example, by ISPs) for purposes such as ad targeting.
                    </div>
                    <div class="para">
                        DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) are often used to encrypt DNS queries to prevent
                        visibility during transmission. The key distinction between the two is the port used. DoT
                        exclusively uses port 853, whereas DoH uses port 443, which is also used by all other HTTPS
                        traffic. DoH is better than DoT in terms of privacy: DoH queries are hidden in regular HTTPS
                        traffic, giving network administrators less visibility while providing users with more privacy,
                        whereas with DoT network administrators can monitor the data.
                    </div>
                    <div class="para">The two techniques have two major drawbacks: centralized DNS presents single
                        points of failure, and the resolver may still link all queries to client IP addresses. Oblivious
                        DNS over HTTPS (ODoH) solves these issues by adding a layer of public key encryption as well as
                        a
                        network proxy between clients and DoH servers. The combination of these two added elements
                        guarantees that only the user has access to both the DNS messages and their own IP address at
                        the same time.</div>
                    <div class="para">
                        It's important to acknowledge that DNS privacy, through these protocols, can negatively impact
                        the public interest
                        such as abuse detection, nefarious content censorship, internet shutdowns, accessibility by
                        third parties or user agents and so on. </div>

                    <h3>Content Blocking (a.k.a adblocking or tracker blocking)</h3>
                    <div class="para">
                        37% of the web uses ad blockers who values choice and control over their browsing experience.
                        The usage of community-maintained pre-defined filter lists (collection of rules that describe
                        what things to block on which websites, e.g., EasyList and EasyPrivacy) can become obsolete
                        and result in functionality breakage across the web. An alternative technique of
                        "sugarcoating", on the other hand, replaces the original tracking script with a
                        privacy-preserving one that mitigates the aforementioned problems.

                    Privacy is simply too complicated to be left in the hands of average consumer (including
                    developers). A remedy is to regulate the infrastructure that collects, stores, and transfers data.
                    The proposed privacy testbed can analyze and understand the privacy behavior of client server
                    applications in a network environment across a large number of hosts in a systematic manner.
                    Using the testbed, developers can instantiate multiple virtual devices with various versions of
                    operating systems to facilitate executing privacy-related analyses. Such a testbed can be utilized
                    by regulators
                    for certification and verification, while consumers can validate application claims

                        <div class="para">Personal data entering an organization can spread like wildfire throughout
                            datasets and storage systems, rendering data lineage untraceable and potentially exposing an
                            organization to privacy and security breaches. Therefore it’s paramount to annotate the data
                            and help developers realize the sensitivity level of the data they are handling. </div>
                        <div class="para">The Twitter team came up with highly granular 504 labels for automated
                            annotation of the columns of a dataset. Automation through machine learning supported the
                            quality and velocity of data annotation. This approach also helped in data discovery
                            (optimizing storage and discovering usage patterns) and data auditing and handling
                            (detecting sensitivity of the accessed data and applying the necessary access control

                            One of the biggest technological assumptions is that users understand the browser cookies,
                            let alone make an informed cookie consent decision and realize the privacy harms. Moreover,
                            cookie
                            consent interfaces fail to comply with regulatory requirements and are often fraught with

                            options, burying the necessary options in links and positioning the cookie banners where
                            users can
                            be ignorant.

                        <h4>Ethical Verbal Consent for Voice Assistants</h4>
                        <div>
                            Typically, voice assistants come with a companion app that collects user consent.
                            Alternatively, having verbal-forward consent can organically integrate into conversation,
                            although this strategy has drawbacks. This includes a lack of information (key details may
                            be
                            missing), a lack of audible distinction (a subtle transition from skill to OS), a break in
                            interface symmetry (the user may have to direct to a companion app to withdraw consent), and
                            time pressure (bound on the response timing). Furthermore, consumers are often unable to
                            distinguish between first- and third-party skills.

                    This year's conference covered a wide range of privacy topics. Following that, PEPR'23 can focus on
                    practical difficulties and discoveries in various other Privacy Enhancing Technologies (differential
                    privacy was a hot topic this year), such as homomorphic encryption, federated analytics, secure
                    multi-party computation, and so on.
                    In addition, we must also look forward to the participation of organizations and academia from all
                    around
                    the world, not limited to Europe and the United States, because a global perspective on privacy is
                    crucial.
