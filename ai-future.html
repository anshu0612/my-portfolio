    <h1 class="heading">The role of Artificial Intelligence in Future Technology</h1>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 1em; color: #39B7CD">May 13, 2019</div>
    <div>
      We stand at the brink of a new economy: a digital economy, where the global workforce will be deeply impacted by
      Artificial Intelligence(AI) and globally more developments are expected tomorrow. AI is the intelligence exhibited
      by a machine or software to perform a task which usually a human is capable of doing [1]. Today major areas of AI
      like Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Robotics, Computer Vision, Machine learning and others, are
      showing exponential growth and making a significant impact in diverse sectors like space, health care, security,
      military, etc. With the ever-increasing amount of data, ubiquitous connectivity, high-performance computing, big
      data, and deep learning present at our disposal, AI is going to add a new level of efficiency and sophistication
      to future technologies.
    </div>

    <h2>Applications of AI in future technologies</h2>
    <div>
      Today, data is streaming in real time, fueled by the booming growth of digital devices, social media, cloud
      computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These data make great dataset for training AI systems. In a few years
      time, AI will touch nearly all the industries on this planet and there are plenty of ways AI is and can transform
      certain industries.
    </div>

    <h3>Health Care</h3>
    <div>
      AI system can help medical physicians deliver faster and accurate treatment by analyzing a large amount of
      clinical data like demographics, medical notes, recordings from medical devices and laboratory images [2]. For
      instance, AI can help in detecting epithelial ovarian cancer in stage 1A when it has a 94% cure rate [3]. Whereas,
      by a normal process, it is usually undetected or is detected in stage 3 or 4, when the symptoms start appearing
      and chances of cure start plummeting. Moreover, Elon Musk’s Neural Lace could be the next AI advancement in the
      field of healthcare. It is an ultra-thin mesh that can be embedded in the skull creating an interface between the
      machine and the brain. Gradually, it would become a part of the brain and help in treating brain disorders [4].
      Researchers are hoping that in future AI may enhance the ability of a human to provide better healthcare services
      [5] and will enhance life expectancy of human civilization.
    </div>

    <h3>Space Industry</h3>
    <div>
      Historically machine learning algorithm has been used in health monitoring of spacecraft, navigation, intelligent
      control and object detection for navigation [6,7,8]. Nowadays private firms are becoming the protagonists rather
      than operating as a contractor in the space industry [9]. One of the notable examples is of SpaceX, in 2018 they
      launched 21 rockets in the space [10]. Blue Origin plans to start space tourism by 2021. NASA is using AI for
      trajectory and payload optimization to increase the efficiency of the next rover mission to Mars [11].
    </div>
    <div>
      AI will extend the boundaries of human compatibilities and will help scientist to reach Europa, Jupiter’s moon
      where scientist believe there could be a subsurface ocean. NASA is currently planning to launch James Webb Space
      Telescope in the orbit around 1.5 million kilometers from the earth in 2020, part of the mission will be
      overlooked by the AI. AI is still gathering momentum in the space industry [12]. The coming years’ mission will be
      turbocharged with AI as we voyage in comets, planets, moons and explore the possibility of mining the comets [12].
    </div>

    <h3>Environmental Protection</h3>
    <div>
      With the impending unprecedented stress caused by global warming, natural disasters, and other human activities,
      AI can help us take concrete steps to better protect our environment. For instance, by using Youtube videos to
      uniquely identify and track the movement of animals, AI can help scientists to identify and protect the endangered
      animals [13]. In future AI can help in greenhouse gas reduction through proper traffic optimization, route
      planning of autonomous public transport and ride-sharing services [14]. It will augment agriculture with the help
      of automated data collection and take corrective action using robots to detect crop diseases which will eventually
      increase the efficiency and reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers. AI will also help in monitoring the
      coral reefs by processing the plethora of images collected by drones and NASA’s satellites [14]. This information
      can help in protecting the reefs from collapse. The intelligence and productivity gains that AI will deliver can
      unlock robust solutions to the environment’s pressing challenges like these.
    </div>

    <h3>Artificial General Intelligence</h3>
    <div>Highly specialized machines like Deep Blue, Watson and AlphaGo are single-purposed AI systems whose
      intelligence is very domain-specific known as Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI) [15]. There is ongoing
      experimental work on Artificial General intelligence that would be flexible enough to learn without supervision
      and adapt to multiple and unexpected situations like humans. In the field of legal systems, it would implement
      concepts like “fairness” and “justice”. After decades, emotional robots won’t be a thing of sci-fi fantasy.</div>

    <h3>Others</h3>
    <div>In other fields like cybersecurity, Artificial Neural Network will play a significant role by consistently
      accumulating intelligence on attacks, breaches, new threats, malware and given all this information AI can learn
      from it and detect abnormalities within an organization’s network and flag it quicker than a member of
      cybersecurity [16]. Harnessing AI, chat-bots will be more effective which will make a great transition from the
      Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the Conversational User Interface (CUI) [17]. Moreover, Automated vehicles will
      be tremendously substituted by driverless cars that would reduce road accidents and better fuel efficiency due to
      smoother braking and acceleration than human drivers. In the military, by harnessing satellite photo
      interpretation capabilities, AI programs could identify potential targets and threats. The next evolution that we
      might see in AI is Neuromorphic Computing, which will be similar to the human brain model. AI can be harnessed
      further to help in getting rid of the errors that human brains are prone to make [18]. Moreover, we might see the
      integration of quantum hardware and software with AI, to solve complex problems within seconds [19].</div>


    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <div>The automation by AI can bring about the unemployment crisis among humans since AI can outperform us in more
      and more fields [20]. Another concern is the potential abuse of AI by hackers, rebel states, and attackers. For
      instance, a commercial drone can be turned into a targeted weapon [21]. Moreover, Scientists believe after
      Artificial General Intelligence, next we might see is Artificial Super Intelligence, which would surpass human
      intelligence [22]. Such super intelligence might rule the world and see humans as a threat and a waste of
      resource.</div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <div>There are trepidations held by people at the negative implications that super-intelligent systems can bring
      about in the future. But, as a mathematician, Kurt Godel illustrated that any logical system, including any
      mathematical one, depends on premises that simply can’t be proved within it — one always require an outside
      authority. For instance, a computer program works by defining rules for it from outside. Similarly, Artificial
      Intelligence isn’t a threat, for it must be programmed in that way first by the outside authority — humans[23,
      24]. We can be more careful in our training sets and filter out answers that we deem acceptable. Such machines can
      be devised that reflect ethical values.</div>
    <div>With driverless cars, drones dropping off packages, virtual assistance determining our tastes and exoskeletons
      supporting disabled there is no denying the fact that AI is going to continue finding applications in everyday
      life. Its usage has the potential to augment and assist human capabilities [25]. There is a high possibility that
      we’ll be communicating with bots like Woebot for fighting depression, without realizing that they aren’t humans.
      Additionally, nowadays big data, high computing, and deep learning are acting as a catalyst in the automation
      process, we may be seeing the democratization of AI in the next few years.</div>
