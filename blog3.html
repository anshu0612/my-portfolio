            <h3>Differential Privacy</h3>
            <div>Differential privacy (DP) is an increasingly popular tool for preserving individuals’ privacy by adding
                statistical uncertainty when sharing sensitive data. DP has practical challenges that include the need
                for iterative exploration and negotiation with data custodians and analysts on the choice of privacy
                parameters, DP variants, and data statistics.
            </div>
            <div class="para">
                Furthermore, there is tension between data minimization and differential privacy: differential privacy
                gives nearly accurate results on large datasets, however, collecting a large amount of data can infringe
                the privacy of individuals and transgress regulations.

                    target="blank">Contextual Integrity (CI)</a>, is another aspect that was introduced, to help with
                these decisional choices
                on applying DP. CI captures socially nuanced requirements of privacy. To capture such nuances, it comes
                with a template for understanding information norms, parameterized in terms of the sender, receiver,
                data subject of the personal information, sensitive attributes of the data subject, and transmission
                principle (the normative rule governing the conditions under which this parameterized information flow
                is (in)appropriate).

            <div class="para">
                Furthermore, a large number of DP libraries have been developed and open-sourced with the primary goal
                of assisting non-experts in applying DP. However, there is a dearth of libraries focusing on
                scalability. The two libraries introduced – <a href="https://gitlab.com/tumult-labs/core"

                    Analytics/Core by Tumult Labs</a>, and <a href="https://pipelinedp.io/"
                    target="blank">PipelineDP</a> by
                Google and OpenMinded – address this problem. The former is built on the <a

                    target="blank">framework of the OpenDP library</a>
                by the Harvard Privacy Team and uses Apache Spark for scalability. The latter library employs Apache
                Spark and Apache Beam to process massive datasets.

            <h3>Gender Privacy</h3>
            <div>
                Applications asking for users’ gender predominantly follow the norm of giving binary options.
                Technologists must recognize the complexity and dynamic nature of gender, as well as the disclosure
                concerns, and must be purpose limited (do you really need to collect gender?). These realizations can
                contribute to technological advancements that respect diverse social groups. Furthermore, the usage of
                gendered honorifics, salutations, and titles is an implicit manner of collecting gender (credit: an
                attendee sharing). This further underscores considering the cultural aspects of gender collection.

            <h3>Privacy in AI Chatbots</h3>
            <div>
                The disconcerting empirical findings revealed that chatbot users can reveal highly sensitive information
                such as political opinions, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, and health data. Some promising
                solutions for developers were presented to address the potential privacy harm to users. These included
                identifying mental health and vulnerable populations, adjusting the interaction mode or interventions,
                safeguarding inadvertent sharing of sensitive information, and avoiding manipulative/dark patterns.
